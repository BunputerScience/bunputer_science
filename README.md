Navigating to source code:
On the GitHub repository, to navigate to the C Sharp files, which are what I
designate as the source code for the project, go into /Assets, then /Scripts.
There will be a few scripts available already, but there are also scripts grouped
together in their own folders (e.g. MainMenuScripts, PuzzleRoomScripts).

Opening the project in Unity:
If the viewer would like to run the project in the Unity application itself, then
the repo is cloneable to the disk. Once on the disk, on the Unity Hub, go to the
Projects tab and click on "Add" and then "Add project from disk" and click on the
cloned folder.

Project Update Since Report:
In the Capstone Testing Report, it is stated that the game over and flop function
will be completed by the portfolio submission. The TimerScript.cs was created that
implements the timer and flop mechanic, but time was exhausted before the script
could be used in the game. The game plays relatively close to the demo presented at
the Capstone Festival.
